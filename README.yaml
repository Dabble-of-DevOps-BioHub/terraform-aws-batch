# Short description of this project
description: |-
  The `terraform-aws-batch` recipe provides a starter template for getting started with AWS Batch. It creates:

    * AWS Batch Compute Environment
      ** Configured for use with the AWS Secrets Manager
    * AWS Job Queue associated to the created Compute Environment

# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).
  
  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  ```hcl
  module "example" {
    source = "https://github.com/Dabble-of-DevOps-BioHub/terraform-aws-batch.git?ref=master"
  }
  ```

  More complete documentation and tutorials coming soon!
